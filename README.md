# ðŸŽ¥ VideoSphere - Fullstack Microservices Video Platform

A production-grade, microservices-based architecture that simulates a modern, high-volume video streaming and processing platform â€” similar to YouTube.
Through this project, I demonstrate my end-to-end software engineering expertise, covering the design and development of distributed system architectures, asynchronous communication, multimedia processing, and full-stack application development.

---

## Description

VideoSphere is a distributed, production-grade video streaming platform that I designed and developed entirely from scratch.  
It allows users to upload, process, and consume video content across multiple resolutions while maintaining scalability, resilience, and asynchronous processing through an event-driven architecture.  

The system follows an **API-First design** approach â€” each microservice exposes its own **OpenAPI specification**, all documented under the `contracts/openapi/` directory.

## Technical Highlights

This project showcases a complete end-to-end implementation of a cloud-ready distributed video platform.

### Backend (Spring Boot)
- Built with **Spring Boot microservices**, leveraging:
  - **Spring WebFlux** for reactive, non-blocking Microservices.
  - **Spring Data JPA** with **PostgreSQL** for persistence.
  - **Spring Kafka** and **Reactor Kafka** for asynchronous event-driven communication.
  - **JWT-based authentication** for secure access.
- Each microservice runs independently, communicating through **Apache Kafka topics**.
- The **Processor Service** uses **FFmpeg** to transcode uploaded videos into multiple resolutions (`1080p`, `720p`, `360p`) and extract video duration.
- The **Stream Service** supports adaptive streaming via **HLS (HTTP Live Streaming)**, efficiently handling `.m3u8` and `.ts` files.
- The **Catalog Service** provides video metadata and leverages **PostgreSQL Full-Text Search** for efficient query matching and related video recommendations.
- The **Notification Service** pushes real-time WebSocket notifications to users (e.g., when video processing completes).
- The **API Gateway** centralizes external API exposure and routes requests to internal services with clear separation of concerns.

### Frontend (Angular)
- Developed with **Angular**, focusing on component reusability and separation of concerns between UI logic and services.
- Integrated **JWT interceptor** that automatically injects the authentication token into each HTTP request.
- Fully responsive design â€” optimized for both desktop and mobile.
- Implemented reusable components like the global **Navbar**, shared across routes and dynamically rendered depending on authentication state.
- The **video player** supports multiple resolutions using **HLS.js**, allowing seamless switching between qualities.
- Real-time **notifications** displayed in the UI upon backend-triggered events.

### DevOps & Deployment
- Entirely **Dockerized** â€” each microservice, along with PostgreSQL, Kafka, and Zookeeper, runs in isolated containers.
- The whole system can be brought up with a single command:
  ```bash
  docker compose up --build

## Architecture

![Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

The platform consists of multiple decoupled microservices communicating asynchronously through Kafka, orchestrated via an API Gateway that handles routing, security, and aggregation.

## Notes & Future Improvements 

Due to environment constraints, the current implementation uses local file storage for video uploads and processing.

However, the architecture is fully designed to support cloud-based storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob).

Adapting it would require a few changes in the Uploader Service, Processor Service and Stream Service to handle file uploads and streaming URLs.
